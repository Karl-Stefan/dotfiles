# My dotfiles 

Please note that this set of dotfiles currently require systemd enviroment.d for setting user enviroment variables, and are therefore kept in the linux/systemd branch.
To initialize use:

```
git clone -b linux/systemd --bare https://github.com/karl-stefan/dotfiles $HOME/.config/dotfiles
```
